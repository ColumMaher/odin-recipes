    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        The authentic version of this iconic Thai noodle dish 
        is made with stir-fried rice noodles coated in a tamarind 
        and fish sauce-based sauce with shrimp, chopped chives, scrambled 
        egg, firm tofu, pickled radish or turnip, and bean sprouts. 
        Pad Thai is a relatively recent invention in Thailand that only 
        began showing up in the mid-20th century. While rice noodle stir-fries 
        have been made in Thailand for centuries, the combination of flavors unique 
        to Pad Thai are fairly new. Once the dish was exported, its easy-to-love 
        sweet and savory flavor made it one of the most popular 
        Thai dishes around the world.
