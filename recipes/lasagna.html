    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a delicious and hearty Italian dish made of stacked layers of wide pasta sheets, typically layered with rich tomato sauce, creamy b√©chamel sauce, and flavorful fillings such as ground meat, cheese, and vegetables. The layers are then baked until the pasta becomes tender, and the flavors meld together to create a scrumptious, comforting casserole. It is a popular and satisfying meal enjoyed by people around the world.
